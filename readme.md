## 📚 Description

Welcome to my learning journey through the Complete AI & LLM Engineering Bootcamp — a course where I, as a student, am learning Python, Git, Docker, Pydantic, LLMs, Agents, RAG, LangChain, LangGraph, and Multi-Modal AI from the ground up.

This is not just another theory course. As a student, I am learning how to code, deploy, and scale real-world AI applications using the same techniques that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
